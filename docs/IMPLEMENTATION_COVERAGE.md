# Game implementation coverage

The conversion uses an independent Go simulation and Ebitengine renderer.
This inventory distinguishes integrated game behavior from extracted artwork
and isolated controller comparisons. A resource export does not by itself
establish that the corresponding encounter is playable.

## Fixed encounters and scripted arenas

| Level | Integrated families | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Three terrain cannon types, bouncing attackers, five-stream middle arena, final body and articulated chain | Integrated scene and complete playthrough comparisons |
| 2 | Terrain cannon, bouncing attackers, hatches, both pod emitters and their creatures, middle defense waves/nodes, final body and transforming minions | Integrated scene and complete playthrough comparisons |
| 3 | Terrain cannons, sweeping attacker, turning projectile, extending chain, tile-edge crawler, middle flying guardian, final worm and conditional scenery | Integrated scene and complete playthrough comparisons |
| 4 | Terrain cannon, extending beam with shaft and animated tip, nest crawler, falling hatches and guns, capsule offspring, twenty-part middle guardian and nineteen-part final guardian | Integrated scene and complete playthrough comparisons |
| 5 | Terrain cannon, destructible barrier, aiming and radial turrets, persistent turrets, ten-member radial formations, vertical attacker, aiming projectile, both compound guardians, growing laser columns and mouth creatures | Integrated scene and complete playthrough comparisons |

The supplied encounter streams contain respectively 5, 6, 7, 6 and 10 selectors,
including the checkpoint selector in each level. Every selector requires an
explicit semantic implementation; unknown selectors must not be mistaken for
empty encounters.

All fixed selector families have explicit implementations. The integration
audit still checks their shared state, drawing, contacts and lifetime boundaries;
selector coverage alone does not establish a complete playable conversion.

## Shared systems

Movement, path commands, deterministic randomness, equipment, projectiles,
terrain coverage, cash and carrier rewards, checkpoint recovery, alternating
players and the shared 159-slot allocator have source comparisons. Terrain and
sprite transparency use their distinct original coverage formats.

Invulnerability uses its original animated aura in the projectile list. Its
counter freezes during ship materialization and successive pickups extend the
existing aura. The source meters for invulnerability, diving and Nashwan use the
original ten images and include their final zero-count frame.

The session has explicit intermediate-shop and stage-completion boundaries.
The two-player stage gate preserves each saved game; level five increases
difficulty and loops to level one. Frontend loading, shop and ending routes are
connected. Live scene comparisons remain separate from simulation tests.

Stage scripts execute before actor updates. New stage actors therefore move in
their construction pass; encounter-table actors are created afterward and move
on the following pass. Enemy counting includes pending-removal entries until
their owning list releases them. Damage and rendering use physical list order.

## Validation boundaries

Private source comparisons run only when the local decoded disk resources and
trace directories are supplied. Those resources and traces remain excluded
from Git. Ordinary tests verify the independent logic without an emulator.

The build draws at 60 updates per second and uses a separate gameplay clock.
Integrated visual comparisons and a complete five-level run remain required.
The current build is in development and is not yet a complete conversion.

Checkpoint restoration across alternating turns, the second guardian's
crowded-scene direction, retained hatch/pod state, and death-image attachment
centers now have explicit implementations and source comparisons. Accepted
continue admission is being checked as the last shared player-flow boundary.

Resource checks exercise every fixed record over 96 callback passes and every
moving wave over 64 passes, verifying animation images, emitted shots, body
patches and overlays against the exported atlases. They do not replace an actual
renderer comparison or a complete game played through its normal controls.
